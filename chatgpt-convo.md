> In this implementation, the IncrementalGame component uses React's useState hook to create a state variable to store the player's wood count. The component also defines a function to handle the player gathering wood, which increments the wood count state variable. The component's UI consists of a display of the player's current wood count, and a button to gather more wood. Every time the button is clicked, the player's wood count is incremented.

> }
> ```
> In this updated package.json file, the homepage property specifies the base URL for the app, which is https://<your-github-username>.github.io/gpt-incremental. This means that when the npm run build command is run, the generated files will be built with this base URL in mind, and any URLs in the app will be relative to this base URL.
>
> You can then upload the files in the docs directory to your GitHub Pages site to host the app, and the app will be accessible at the gpt-incremental subdirectory of your GitHub Pages site.

> import IncrementalGame from './IncrementalGame';
>
> ReactDOM.render(<IncrementalGame />, document.getElementById('root'));
> ```
> In the index.html file, the div with the id of root is the element in which the IncrementalGame component will be rendered.

> In the index.js file, the IncrementalGame component is imported and rendered to the root element using ReactDOM's render method.

>
> **ChatGPT**
> Here is an example of how you could update your package.json file to remove the docs directory before running the build command:
> ```
> {
>   "name": "my-app",
>   "version": "1.0.0",
>   "private": true,
>   "homepage": "https://<your-github-username>.github.io/gpt-incremental",

>     "test": "react-scripts test",
>     "eject": "react-scripts eject"
>   },
>   ...
> }
> ```
> In this updated package.json file, the build command now includes the rm -rf docs command, which removes the docs directory if it exists before running the react-scripts build command. This ensures that the docs directory is always removed before a new build is performed, so that old files from previous builds are not included in the new build.
