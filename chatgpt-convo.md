> In this implementation, the IncrementalGame component uses React's useState hook to create a state variable to store the player's wood count. The component also defines a function to handle the player gathering wood, which increments the wood count state variable. The component's UI consists of a display of the player's current wood count, and a button to gather more wood. Every time the button is clicked, the player's wood count is incremented.

> In this updated package.json file, the homepage property specifies the base URL for the app, which is https://<your-github-username>.github.io/gpt-incremental. This means that when the npm run build command is run, the generated files will be built with this base URL in mind, and any URLs in the app will be relative to this base URL.

> In this updated package.json file, the build command now includes the rm -rf docs command, which removes the docs directory if it exists before running the react-scripts build command. This ensures that the docs directory is always removed before a new build is performed, so that old files from previous builds are not included in the new build.
